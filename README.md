# openintrostats_slides
A set of slides for OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition - based on slides for Intro Stats with Randomization, also by OpenIntro.org, and also on slides for the OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd edition book (below).

Slides for Intro Stats originally created by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel ([mine-cetinkaya-rundel](http://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel)) and available as PPTX or Google Slides format on [openintro.org](http://openintro.org). Adapted version done in R Markdown at [github.com/wesleyburr/introstat_random](https://github.com/wesleyburr/introstat_random). The OpenIntro Statistics book expands on some material from the Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, so these slides will necessarily be more involved than those from /instrostat_random. 

LaTeX source for slides for the eight chapters of OpenIntro Statistics: [OpenIntroOrg/openintro-statistics-slides](https://github.com/OpenIntroOrg/openintro-statistics-slides). This adaptation (to Rmd plus corrections) does not follow those slides exactly, but should **definitely** be considered to be **highly** derivative. 

Pull requests gratefully accepted, especially for pedagogical corrections; but typos, image corrections, and style sheet things also very welcome.
