# openintrostats_slides
A set of slides for OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition - based on slides for Intro Stats with Randomization, also by OpenIntro.org.

Slides originally created by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel ([mine-cetinkaya-rundel](http://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel)) and available as PPTX or Google Slides format on openintro.org. Adapted version done in R Markdown at github.com/wesleyburr/introstat_random. The OpenIntro Statistics book expands on some material from the Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, so these slides will necessarily be more involved than those from /instrostat_random. 

Pull requests gratefully accepted, especially for pedagogical corrections; but typos, image corrections, and style sheet things also very welcome.
